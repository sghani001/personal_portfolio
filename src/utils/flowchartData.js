/** Interactive system flowchart — nodes, edges, and per-tech telemetry specs.
 *
 * NOTE: cluster.x / cluster.y / cluster.w have been removed. The component now
 * places clusters with CSS Grid named areas (see SystemFlowchart.jsx), so each
 * cluster's `id` below must match a grid-area name exactly: infra, integrations,
 * frontend, data, payments. No manual coordinates needed — rows auto-size to
 * content, so this can't overlap regardless of how many items a cluster has.
